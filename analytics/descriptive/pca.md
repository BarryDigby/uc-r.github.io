Principal Component Analysis (PCA) involves the process by which principal components are computed, and their role in understanding the data. PCA is an unsupervised approach, which means that it is performed on a set of variables $$X_1$$, $$X_2$$, ..., $$X_p$$ with no associated response $$Y$$. PCA reduces the dimensionality of the data set, allowing most of the variability to be explained using fewer variables.  PCA is commonly used as one step in a series of analyses. You can use PCA to reduce the number of variables and avoid multicollinearity, or when you have too many predictors relative to the number of observations.

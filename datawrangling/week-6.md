The last couple of weeks we have been working with data frames.  Data frames are the most common way of storing data in R and, generally, is the data structure most often used for data analyses; it is R's version of an Excel spreadsheet. This week we are going to put more focus on working with this style of data.  Specifically, we are going to concentrate on the following:

1. Understand the basics of dealing with data frames
2. Comprehend a new concept known as *"tibbles,"* which makes working with data frames even easier
3. Learn how to organize your data in a *tidy* way
4. Manage relational, but separate, data frames

## Tutorials & Resources

Please work through the following tutorials prior to Saturday’s class. The skills and functions introduced in these tutorials will be necessary to complete your assignment, which is due at the beginning of Saturday’s class, and will also be used in Saturday’s in-class small group work.

**Data frames:** Basic understanding of data frames is essential. To understand the fundamentals of working with data frames read and work through the [*Managing Data Frames* tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/dataframes).  You should also read through the [*Dealing with Missing Values* tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/missing_values) so that you understand how to handle missing values in your data frames.

**Tibbles:**  As Hadley Wickham states *"tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviours to make life a little easier."*  Read and work through *[Chapter 10: Tibbles](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html)* to understand the difference between a basic data frame and a tibble. 

**Tidy data:**  A tremendous amount of time is spent on fundamental preprocessing tasks to get your data into the right form in order to feed it into the visualization and modeling stages. This typically requires a large amount of reshaping of your data. If you understand the proper way to organize your data up-front you will save yourself a lot of time during the analysis phase. Read and work through [*Chapter 12: Tidy Data*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) to learn how to consistently organize your data.

**Relational data:** It’s rare that a data analysis involves only a single data set. Typically you have many sets of data and you need to join them to perform your analysis and answer the questions that you’re interested in. To learn how to work with joining relational data read and work through [*Chapter 13: Relational Data*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html).

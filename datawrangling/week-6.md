title: Week 6 (November 13 - 19)
permalink: data_wrangling/week-6
---

The last couple of weeks we have been learning to import, tidy, manipulate, and visualize our data. For the most part this was applied to pretty standard data.  Unfortunately, many times our data are not standard and contains very messy character strings that we need to clean up or extract patterns from or we have date-time stamp data that we need to manipulate. We've also seen how factors can determine how our data are organized and portrayed. This week we are going to put more focus on working with these concerns.  Specifically, we are going to concentrate on the following:

1. Working with strings and regular expressions
2. Handling factors
3. Managing date-time data

## Tutorials & Resources

Please work through the following tutorials prior to Saturday’s class. The skills and functions introduced in these tutorials will be necessary to complete your assignment, which is due at the beginning of Saturday’s class, and will also be used in Saturday’s in-class small group work.

**Strings & regex:** To understand the fundamentals of working with strings and regex data read and work through [*Chapter 14: Strings*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html).  If your final project is going to require you to work with lots of messy character string data you can get more practice by working through the [*Dealing with Characters* tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/characters) and [*Dealing with Regular Expressions*](http://uc-r.github.io/regex) tutorials.

**Factors:**  Historically, factors were much easier to work with than characters. As a result, many of the functions in base R automatically convert characters to factors. This means that factors often crop up in places where they’re not actually helpful and you need to understand how to manipulate and work with them. Read and work through *[Chapter 15: Factors](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html)*. 

**Dates:**  Real world data are often associated with dates and time; however, dealing with dates accurately can appear to be a complicated task due to the variety in formats and accounting for time-zone differences and leap years. Read and work through [*Chapter 16: Dates and times*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) to learn how to manage date-time data.

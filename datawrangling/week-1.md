Welcome to week 1. Although we will not meet in class until the end of this week (Saturday, October 20<sup>th</sup>), I do not want to waste time in getting started. We only have 7 weeks together (&#x1f622;) so I want to pack each week as full as possible. I am assuming you have fully read the syllabus ([electronic](http://uc-r.github.io/data_wrangling) or [hardcopy](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n0iql9tlkmhzjk3/Data%20Wrangling%20with%20R%20Syllabus%20%282018%20Spring%29.pdf?dl=1)) by now but if not please do so that you understand how this class is structured and what is expected of you.  I will spend the first few minutes of class on Saturday re-iterating a few points so that we are all on the same page but I do not want to spend 30-60 minutes doing so, so make sure you read (and re-read) it thoroughly.

The focus of this week is two-fold:

1. To get yourself (re-)introduced to R and the RStudio IDE.
2. To introduce you to workflow features that improve the organization and communication of your analyses.  

Below outlines the tutorials that you need to review, and the assignments you need to complete, __*prior*__ to Saturday's class. The skills and functions introduced in these tutorials will be necessary for Saturday's in-class activities. If you have any questions or concerns your first step should be going to our [slack channel](https://uc-data-wrangling.slack.com/) and posting your issue.  You and your classmates should be monitoring slack to help each other out. In addition, I will also be watching slack and will chime in when necessary but my hope is that this will be a social process where everyone contributes to knowledge advancement.

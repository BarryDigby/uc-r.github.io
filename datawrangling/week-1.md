Welcome to week 1. Although we will not meet in class until the end of this week (Saturday), I do not want to waste time in getting started. We only have 7 weeks together (&#x1f622;) so I want to pack each week as full as possible. I am assuming you have fully read the [syllabus](data_wrangling/syllabus) by now but if not please do so that you understand how this class is structured and what is expected of you.  I will spend the first few minutes of class on Saturday re-iterating the details so that we are all on the same page but I do not want to spend 30-60 minutes doing so, so make sure you read (and re-read) it thoroughly.

The focus of this week is to get yourself (re-)introduced to data wrangling, R, and the general workflow that makes for productive analyses.  Below outlines the tutorials that you need to review, additional resource available to you, and the assignment that is due at the beginning of Saturday's class. If you have any questions or concerns your first step should be going to our [slack channel](https://uc-data-wrangling.slack.com/) and posting your issue.  You and your classmates should be monitoring slack to help each other out. In addition, I will also be watching slack and will chime in when necessary but my hope is that this will be a social process where everyone contributes to knowledge advancement.

## Tutorials & Resources

Please work through the following tutorials prior to Saturday's class. The skills and functions introduced in these tutorials will be necessary to complete your assignment, which is due at the beginning of Saturday's class, and will also be used in Saturday's in-class small group work. 

### Introduction to the course, data wrangling, and R


Before our first meeting, install R and the RStudio Desktop IDE (you may wish to install the preview version to get notebook support).

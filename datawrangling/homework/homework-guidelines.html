<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">Coding style</td>
<td align="left">Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding manual is followed, code is well commented</td>
<td align="left">Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments</td>
<td align="left">Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">Coding strategy</td>
<td align="left">Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors</td>
<td align="left">Code is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some “hacking” instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors.</td>
<td align="left">Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">Presentation: graphs</td>
<td align="left">Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point</td>
<td align="left">Graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels.</td>
<td align="left">Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">Presentation: tables</td>
<td align="left">Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features.</td>
<td align="left">Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.</td>
<td align="left">Table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity</td>
<td align="left">Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.</td>
<td align="left">Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition.</td>
<td align="left">Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work</td>
<td align="left">Access as easy as possible, code runs!</td>
<td align="left">Satisfactory</td>
<td align="left">Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions and/or code does not run</td>

Each week you will be assigned homework that you will need to be completed prior to the Saturday session. 

Students submit homework once a week. The end result may still resemble a “final project” or portfolio, but one that has been built up gradually over the term.

Each homework will be evaluated by 3 peer reviewers. The performance of thoughtful peer review will count as 15% of the overall course mark.

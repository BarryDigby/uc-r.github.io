Welcome to week 1. 

## Tutorials & Resources

Please work through the following tutorials prior to Saturday's class. The skills and functions introduced in these tutorials will be necessary to complete your assignment, which is due at the beginning of Saturday's class, and will also be used in Saturday's in-class small group work. 

### Introduction to the course, data wrangling, and R

- Read about the [Role of Data Wrangling](http://uc-r.github.io/why_wrangle)
- Work through the [R Basics tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/section2_basics) to (re-)familiarize yourself with the basic functionality of R and RStudio


### Managing your workflow

- Work through the [R Projects tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/r_projects)
- Work through the [R Markdown tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/r_markdown)
- Not necessary but for those more ambitious folks, work through the [R Notebook](http://uc-r.github.io/r_notebook) tutorial. This will require you to install the [Preview Release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) version of RStudio.

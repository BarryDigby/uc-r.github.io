 > *"What we have is a data glut."* - Vernon Vinge


Data are being generated by everything around us at all times. Every digital process and social media exchange produces it. Systems, sensors and mobile devices transmit it. Countless databases collect it. Data are arriving from multiple sources at an alarming rate and analysts and organizations are seeking ways to leverage these new sources of information. Consequently, analysts need to understand how to *get* data from these data sources.  Furthermore, since analysis is often a collaborative effort analysts also need to know how to share their data.

Welcome to week 2!  This week we will cover the process of [importing](#import), [exporting](#export), and [scraping](#scrape) data. First, we cover the basics of importing tabular and spreadsheet data. I also cover the equally important process of getting data out of R. Then, since modern day data wrangling often includes scraping data from the flood of web-based data becoming available to organizations and analysts, I cover the fundamentals of web-scraping with R. This includes importing spreadsheet data files stored online, scraping HTML text and data tables, and leveraging APIs.  Consequently, this section will give you a strong foundation for the different ways to get your data into and out of R.

## Tutorials & Resources

Please work through the following tutorials prior to Saturday's class. The skills and functions introduced in these tutorials will be necessary to complete your assignment, which is due at the beginning of Saturday's class, and will also be used in Saturday's in-class small group work. 

### Importing and exporting spreadsheet data

- Read & work through the [Importing Data tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/import)
- Read & work through the [Exporting Data tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/exporting)
    - Newbies can focus on [exporting to text files](http://uc-r.github.io/exporting#export_text_files) and [exporting to R objects](http://uc-r.github.io/exporting#export_r_objects)
    - Those more ambitious can also work through [exporting to Excel portion](http://uc-r.github.io/exporting#export_excel_files)


### Scraping text & tables

- Read & work through the [Importing spreadsheet data files stored online](Importing spreadsheet data files stored online) portion of the [Scraping Data tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/scraping)
- Not necessary but for those more ambitious folks, work through the following sections of the [Scraping Data tutorial](http://uc-r.github.io/scraping): [Scraping HTML text](http://uc-r.github.io/scraping#scraping_HTML_text), [Scraping HTML tables](http://uc-r.github.io/scraping#scraping_HTML_tables), and [Leveraging APIs to scrape data](http://uc-r.github.io/scraping#scraping_api)

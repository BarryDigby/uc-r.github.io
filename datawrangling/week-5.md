The last couple of weeks we have been working with data frames.  Data frames are the most common way of storing data in R and, generally, is the data structure most often used for data analyses; it is R's version of an Excel spreadsheet. This week we are going toput more focus on working with this style of data.  Specifically, we are going to concentrate on the following:

1. Understand the basics of dealing with data frames
2. Comprehend a new concept known as *"tibbles,"* which makes working with data frames even easier
3. Learn how to organize your data in a *tidy* way
4. Manage relational, but separate, data frames

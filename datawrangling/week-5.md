Being able to create visualizations (graphical representations) of data is a key step in data analysis. In this module you will learn to use the `ggplot2` library to visualize your data. As illustrated in week 2, R does provide built-in plotting functions; however, the `ggplot2` library implements what is known as the [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448). This makes it particularly effective for describing how visualizations should represent data, and has turned it into the preeminent plotting library in R.

The following tutorials will provide you the knowledge and skills required to create the meaningful, elegant, and finely tuned  data visualizations that I will be looking for in your final project.

1. __Introduction to `ggplot2`:__ Read and work through [Chapter 3: Data Visualization](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) in R for Data Science to get an introduction to the `ggplot2` package.
    - Now that you've learned the basics, complete the [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/data-wrangling-with-r/assignments/9242) and the [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/data-wrangling-with-r/assignments/9243) DataCamp assignments to hone your skills.

2. __Advancing your visualizations:__ In your final project I will be looking for publication worthy visualizations. Thus, I fully expect your visualizations to improve with each deliverable submitted. Therefore it is essential that you learn how to use some of the more advanced features of `ggplot2` and other packages that work with `ggplot2`.  Here are some resources to help you take your visualizations to the next level:  
    - Reading and working through [Chapter 28: Graphics for Communication](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html) in R for Data Science.
    - Review some of the currently available [advanced plotting tutorials](ggplot).
    - Although not required, you can further hone you advanced visualization skills with the [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 3)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-part-3) DataCamp module, which covers statistical, network, and mapping plots along with some of the internal functioning of `ggplot2`.

## Class

Please download this material for Saturday's: &nbsp; <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/powzifsazrok00f/AAB4RimS4pEXpLVV8xJECmbla?dl=1" style="color:black;"><i class="fa fa-cloud-download" style="font-size:1em"></i></a>

In addition, be sure to bring your final project data to class because you will work on it during class.  Furthermore, identify at least 10 specific questions you want to ask of your project data. Using what you learned this week, what type of visualizations can you apply to help answer these questions? Be ready to use `ggplot2` to answer these questions in class.

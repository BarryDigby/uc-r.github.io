Being able to create visualizations (graphical representations) of data is a key step in data analysis. In this module you will learn to use the `ggplot2` library to visualize your data. As illustrated in the last module R does provide built-in plotting functions; however, the `ggplot2` library implements what is known as the [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448). This makes it particularly effective for describing how visualizations should represent data, and has turned it into the preeminent plotting library in R.

The following tutorials will provide you the knowledge and skills required to create the meaningful, elegant, and finely tuned  data visualizations that I will be looking for in the remainder of your project deliverables.

1. __Introduction to `ggplot2`:__ Read and work through [Chapter 3: Data Visualization](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) in R for Data Science to get an introduction to the `ggplot2` package.
    - Now that you've learned the basics, complete the [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/data-wrangling-with-r/assignments/9242) DataCamp assignment to hone your skills.

2. __Advancing your visualizations:__ In your final project I will be looking for publication worthy visualizations. Thus, I fully expect your visualizations to improve with each deliverable submitted. Therefore it is essential that you learn how to use some of the more advanced features of `ggplot2` and other packages that work with `ggplot2`.  Here are some resources to help you take your visualizations to the next level:  
    - Reading and working through [Chapter 28: Graphics for Communication](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html) in R for Data Science.
    - Review some of the currently available [advanced plotting tutorials](ggplot).
    - Now that you have some more advanced skills, complete the [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/data-wrangling-with-r/assignments/9243) DataCamp assignment to hone your skills.

## Class

Please download this material for Saturday's: &nbsp; <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kksvnl5pfvh8g5y/AAB3gsok1t4ebY-2GcKJi5b8a?dl=1" style="color:black;"><i class="fa fa-cloud-download" style="font-size:1em"></i></a>

In addition, be sure to have identified which data you are going to use for your final project.  Be sure to have access to this data because you will work on it during class.  Furthermore, identify at least 10 specific questions you want to ask of your project data. Using what you learned this week, what type of data transformations do you need to make to help answer these questions? Be ready to use dplyr to answer these questions in class.

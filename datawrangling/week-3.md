So last week we started to import data. However, data by themselves are pretty useless so we need to start doing some basic care and feeding of the data we've imported. This week we investigate good practices for when we get a new data set. Spending a little time up front to understand your data will help speed up your analysis later on. Thus, this week we are going to focus on four objectives that we should have when we first open up a new data set:

1. Review the codebook
2. Learn about the data
3. Visualize the data

## Tutorials & Resources

Please work through the following tutorials prior to Saturday’s class. The skills and functions introduced in these tutorials will be necessary to complete your assignment, which is due at the beginning of Saturday’s class, and will also be used in Saturday’s in-class small group work.

## Course Description 

Welcome to Data Wrangling with R! This course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to Data Wrangling with the R programming language. You will learn the fundamental skills required to acquire, munge, transform, manipulate, and visualize data in a computing environment that fosters reproducibility.


## Course Objectives
Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to:

- Perform your data analysis in a literate programming environment
- Manage different types of data
- Manage different data structures
- Import, scrape, and export data
- Index, subset, reshape and transform your data
- Compute descriptive statistics
- Visualize data
- Perform loop control statements
- Write your own functions

...all with R!

## Class Structure 

Each week I plan to have you read through selected tutorials on specific data wrangling activities in R.  I will assign problems/activities that you will need to perform prior to each Saturday session...

The in-class sessions will consist of both lectures, live coding by the instructor and hands-on programming by the students. The hands-on practice will be sequential in which students will practice applying code as it is learned. 


## Material
All required classroom material will be provided in class or online. Any recommended yet optional material will also be provided in the classroom notes.

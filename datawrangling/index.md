## Course Description 

Welcome to Data Wrangling with R! This course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to Data Wrangling with the R programming language. You will learn the fundamental skills required to acquire, munge, transform, manipulate, and visualize data in a computing environment that fosters reproducibility.


## Course Objectives
Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to:

- Perform your data analysis in a literate programming environment
- Manage different types of data
- Manage different data structures
- Import, scrape, and export data
- Index, subset, reshape and transform your data
- Compute descriptive statistics
- Visualize data
- Perform loop control statements
- Write your own functions

...all with R!

## Class Structure 

Each week I plan to have you read through selected tutorials on specific data wrangling activities in R. I will assign problems/activities that you will need to perform prior to each Saturday session. Then in each Saturday class I'll spend about 30 minutes reviewing the data wrangling activity and answer any burning questions. Then you will break up into defined small groups and review each others code and approaches to solving the assigned problems. And finally, for the last hour of class you and your small group will work together to complete another problem within this same data wrangling domain.

The purpose for this course structure is multi-dimensional:

1. It will teach you to read and learn R programming tutorials and techniques on your own
2. The out-of-class assignments will force you to come to each class prepared and these assignments will also prepare you for your final project
3. The in-class peer review will help you get feedback on your code and also teach you to review other people's code
4. The in-class small group work will teach you to work on a coding task collaboratively and within a constrained time limit


## Material
All required classroom material will be provided in class or online. Any recommended yet optional material will also be provided in the classroom notes.

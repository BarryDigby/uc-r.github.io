### Structure of Class Time 

The in-class modules will consist of both lectures, live coding by the instructor and hands on programming by the students. The hands on practice will be sequential in which students will practice applying code as it is learned. 

### Class Prep

Since we have limited class time be sure you have R and RStudio downloaded and operational **before** class.  You can find instructions to install R and RStudio at https://wfu-r.github.io/basics#installation.  You will want to make sure your version of R is >= 3.4 and RStudio is >= 1.0.143.
